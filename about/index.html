	<h1>about</h1>
	<p>
	The Math Journal Straw Poll is intended to provide early-career mathematicians with an approximate ranking of research journals in mathematics.
	Perhaps the only important way of ranking such journals is by the opinions of those who may look at journal titles when evaluating job and grant applications.
	This poll aggregates the personal journal rankings used by established mathematicians.
	</p>
	<p>
	This resource is managed by <a href="https://shmckean.github.io">Stephen McKean</a>. 
	If you are interested in contributing your rankings, please see the <a href="../submit">submissions page</a>.
	If you would like to contact me for some other reason, feel free to reach out at <a data-name="mckean" data-domain="math.byu" data-tld="edu" href="#" class="cryptedmail" onclick="window.location.href = 'mailto:' + this.dataset.name + '@' + this.dataset.domain + '.' + this.dataset.tld"></a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	There are many other resources that can help one decide where to submit their paper.
	A noteworthy example is the AMS Backlog of Mathematics Journals, which lists the average wait times from submission to final decision in various journals.
	In the future, I may incorporate this backlog data into this site's journal data.
	</p>
	<p>
	For now, I will just link to the AMS Backlog from the years  <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201910/rnoti-p1713.pdf">2018</a>, <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202010/rnoti-p1607.pdf">2019</a>, <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202110/rnoti-p1802.pdf">2020</a>, and <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202210/rnoti-p1810.pdf">2021</a>.
	There is probably more recent data available, but this is what I found after a quick search.

	<h2>faq</h2>
	<h3><a class="absbutton" id="why-rank" href="javascript:;">Why rank journals? &ensp;<span id="or-why-rank" class="stretch" style="font-size:16px">&or;</span><span id="and-why-rank" class="stretch" style="font-size:16px;display:none">&and;</span></a></h3>
	<div style="display:none;overflow-x:auto" id="abs-why-rank">
	<p>
	The best way to evaluate a mathematician's work is to understand it yourself, or to discuss the work with somebody who does understand it.
	This generally takes a large amount of time and effort, so we often rely on proxies of the quality of mathematical work &mdash; especially when many mathematicians must be compared in a short amount of time, such as in job and grant applications.
	</p>
	<p>
	The journal that a paper appears in is a common proxy for the quality of that work.
	Having a ranking of journals allows one to use this proxy more transparently.
	How <em>effective</em> such a proxy is depends on how "accurate" the rankings are.
	</p>
	</div>

	<h3><a class="absbutton" id="why-poll" href="javascript:;">Why use a poll? &ensp;<span id="or-why-poll" class="stretch" style="font-size:16px">&or;</span><span id="and-why-poll" class="stretch" style="font-size:16px;display:none">&and;</span></a></h3>
	<div style="display:none;overflow-x:auto" id="abs-why-poll">
	<p>
	If you ask a few mathematicians about how certain journals compare to one another, you will quickly learn that there is no clear consensus on how journals rank.
	Perhaps the only thing mathematicians can agree on is that bibliometrics usually lead to poor journal rankings.
	</p>
	<p>
	This poll provides a journal ranking based on mathematicians' personal opinions.
	As the number of responses increases, the ranking will give a more accurate reflection of journals' statuses in the eyes of the mathematical community.
	</p>
	</div>

	<h3><a class="absbutton" id="who" href="javascript:;">Who can contribute? &ensp;<span id="or-who" class="stretch" style="font-size:16px">&or;</span><span id="and-who" class="stretch" style="font-size:16px;display:none">&and;</span></a></h3>
	<div style="display:none;overflow-x:auto" id="abs-who">
	<p>
	As these rankings are meant to give a sense of the mathematical community's opinion on journals, only published mathematicians should submit a response to the straw poll.
	In addition, responders should have already received their PhD and be actively working in a research capacity.
	For more details on how to submit a response, see the <a href="../submit">submission page</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	There are certainly exceptions to these rules.
	If you meet the above criteria but do not have any strong opinions about journals, you should probably not submit a response.
	If you do not meet the above criteria but feel that your ranking should still be accepted, feel free to email me at <a data-name="mckean" data-domain="math.byu" data-tld="edu" href="#" class="cryptedmail" onclick="window.location.href = 'mailto:' + this.dataset.name + '@' + this.dataset.domain + '.' + this.dataset.tld"></a> with an explanation of your circumstances.
	</p>

	<h3><a class="absbutton" id="anon" href="javascript:;">How do I stay anonymous if I have to email you? &ensp;<span id="or-anon" class="stretch" style="font-size:16px">&or;</span><span id="and-anon" class="stretch" style="font-size:16px;display:none">&and;</span></a></h3>
	<div style="display:none;overflow-x:auto" id="abs-anon">
	<p>
	In order to prevent spam and other unwanted responses, there has to be some sort of verification process for poll submissions.
	For lack of a better verification procedure, you will need to email me your identity before submitting your response.
	However, your email address, zbMATH Author ID, and hash will not be accessible on this site.
	Your hash will be stored with your submission, but these submissions will be cleaned and hashes removed before being uploaded to the site.
	</p>

	<h3><a class="absbutton" id="why-isnt" href="javascript:;">Why isn't [journal] ranked higher/lower? &ensp;<span id="or-why-isnt" class="stretch" style="font-size:16px">&or;</span><span id="and-why-isnt" class="stretch" style="font-size:16px;display:none">&and;</span></a></h3>
	<div style="display:none;overflow-x:auto" id="abs-why-isnt">
	<p>
	You would have to ask the mathematicians who have submitted their personal rankings.
	One possible explanation is that how a journal is perceived can vary wildly from one research area to another.
	If you feel that your research area is not adequately represented in these rankings, please encourage your colleagues to <a href="../submit">contribute to the poll!</a>
	</p>
	</div>

	<h3><a class="absbutton" id="different" href="javascript:;">Shouldn't you have done [such-and-such] differently? &ensp;<span id="or-different" class="stretch" style="font-size:16px">&or;</span><span id="and-different" class="stretch" style="font-size:16px;display:none">&and;</span></a></h3>
	<div style="display:none;overflow-x:auto" id="abs-different">
	<p>
	Almost certainly yes.
	For example, I am sure there are better ways to form an aggregate ranking out of ragged partial response data.
	However, I found that all implementations of these rankings were too slow for a smooth user experience.
	</p>
	<p>
	Of course, the  main constraints are my limited time and abilities.
	Most of my working time goes towards research, teaching, and mentoring.
	This project falls under my service duties, and its priority is fairly low among those duties.
